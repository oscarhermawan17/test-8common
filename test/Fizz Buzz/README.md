# Challenge 2 - FizzBuzz

Please make a react component and make a function that takes in a start number and finish number and produces a CSV string of results.

So, in this component you will be providing 2 textboxes for user to input start number and finish number and 1 button to submit.
add required fields validation for start number and finish number.
There is no criteria for the page design/layout, you can build it as simple as you can.
you can also using MaterialUI components if you want.


- For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, will print "FizzBuzz".
- For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, will print "Fizz".
- For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, will print "Buzz".

For example `fizzBuzz(12, 20)` should return a string: 
`"Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz"`

this component can be put on a new page, or the sampe page with the challenge 1

- For extra points! but not essential
    - Typescript
